This spreadsheet is for analyzing the CubeSatSim APRS and CW telemetry ONLY.  Note that this spreadsheet is based on the original AMSAT OSCAR 7 AO-7 Morse Code Telemetry Decoder spreadsheet: https://www.amsat.org/amsat/ftp/software/spreadsheet/AO7tlmSS.xls 

The best telemetry for the CubeSatSim is FSK which uses the AMSAT FoxTelem software to automatically demodulate, decode, and graph the data.

Instructions:

Copy your raw telemetry data into the Data Input tab.  If you don't have any data, copy data from the Sample Data tab.  

The odd rows can be a callsign or time timestamp (which is ignored) while the even rows should contain frames of telemetry data (beginning with "hi hi" then a series of 3 digit numbers).  If this isn't the case, you will need to edit until even lines starting at row 2 contain frames of telemetry.

The telemetry starting in Row 2 will be automatically calculated and plotted.

See plots in Voltage Graphs, Current Graphs, and Temperature Graph tabs.

To see raw data or create a new plot, go to Graphs tab.
